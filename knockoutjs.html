 at http://knockoutjs.com/ at the "Live Example" section
 it looks like you need to perform that "activates knockout" action that 
 binds data from javascript into the DOM
 Right now, this cshtml file is populated on the server, not the client.
 The c# server will take the data from the ViewBag and interpolate it into
 the html template to return to the client. 
 Knockout is designed so that you can manipulate the DOM without having to go
 back to the server for a whole new HTML request/response

 You can mix them up, esp for learning a new library like knockout, but 
 keep in mind that difference. So for example, let's say you want to server-side 
 render the document, but then do some extra interactivity with knockout.
 It might look like this:

 I have 3 sections for you, problem is all JS has to been in one part,
and all the DOM in another, otherwise I'd group the 3 sections together
-->
<script type='text/javascript' src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/knockout/3.4.2/knockout-debug.js'></script>

<!-- Part 1 -->
<p>Ingredient name: <strong data-bind="text: ingredientName"></strong></p>
<p>Recipe name: <strong data-bind="text: recipeName"></strong></p>


<!-- Part 2 with a foreach --> 
<ul data-bind="foreach: ingredients">
	<li data-bind="text: name"></li>
</ul>

<!-- 
Where it gets odd is when you are using a server-side template like cshtml,
because you are already putting all the data into the template already. It is just an
extra step to have knockout put it into the DOM for you, when cshtml does that already

So you see that knockout is probably overkill for a simple view of data, because it
wont make displaying data any easier. What it DOES do well is make interactive pages
much easier. This is hard to put into a basic MVC site. MVC is designed to make it so 
you "dont need tools like knockout", and breaking out of that pattern can be pretty 
hard to do. 

But let's think of something useful that knockout could add to a server-side rendered 
inventory. How about live pricing of ingredients, and a running count of the cost? It won't 
be on the server, but it could be on the client only.

I will use the fake api called "jsonplaceholder" for dummy data
-->

<button data-bind="click: fetchPrices">Fetch 'prices'</button>
<ul data-bind="foreach: prices">
	<li>
		Name: <span data-bind="text: title"></span>
		Price: <span data-bind="text: id"></span>
	</li>
</ul>
Total: <span data-bind="text: priceSum"></span>

<script>
function IngredientViewModel() {
	// PART 1 - Static data
	this.ingredientName = "TEST PART"; // could be @ViewBag.ingDetails.IngredientName
	this.recipeName = "TEST NAME"; //     see ^

	// PART 2 - Static list data
        // just demoing a list/foreach pattern
        this.ingredients = [
            { name: 'Honey'},
            { name: 'Cheese'},
            { name: 'Fish'}
        ];

	// PART 3 - Making http request
	// needs to be an observable to start, otherwise it
        // wont update the DOM when it changes
	this.prices = ko.observable();
	this.priceSum = ko.observable();
	// the button click event calls this
	this.fetchPrices = function() {
		var that = this;
		// finding a list of "prices" from a free list of todos online
		fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/')
		// convert response to json
		  .then(response => response.json())
		// save the first five into prices and priceSum
		  .then(json => {
			console.log(json);
 			// first 5
			var priceObjects = json.slice(0,5)
 			// notify the DOM to redraw using new data into the observable
			that.prices(priceObjects);
                        var sum = priceObjects.reduce((a, b) => a + b.id, 0)
		        that.priceSum(sum);	
			})
		}
